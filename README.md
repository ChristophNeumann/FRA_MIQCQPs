# FRA_MIQCQPs
This project implements feasible rounding approaches for mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic programgs. 
This code was used for the computational experiments from 
[granularity in mixed-integer programming](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-019-01591-y). 
It runs under Python 3.6, using Pyomo 5.7 with Gurobi as MILP-solver and IPOPT as NLP-solver.
